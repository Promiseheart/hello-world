# hello-world
Introduction to CS50; problem set 0.  
I am about to turn 41 years old.  I have been married for over 7 years and have two wonderful children, 7 and 4.  I am looking into broadening my career into something I may enjoy doing with code. I work around robots and machines, I enjoy playing video games (grew up with NES), and have facebook, twitter, and other social media outlets.  I even had a myspace page.
